The ATRSHMLOG tee demo program.  {#files_atrshmlogtee_c}
====================================

This is the tee demo program.

Its name is

      atrshmlogtee

As the real tee it is a filter that reads from standard input
and writes to standard output.

Its a one to one thing.

Internal it uses the log to write a copy of the data into the log.

So its a demo and its also a test program.

You can extract from the log and reconstruct the original.

Use a cut -c191- (for this version) on the converts output.

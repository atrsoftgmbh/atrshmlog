The ATRSHMLOG shmbininternalfiles script.  {#files_shmbininternalfiles_script}
====================================

The file is a list of all files that are created
from the link of the module to a object file
and an internal object.

The file is used in makeall.

If you create a new file and you want to make it with makeall add it to
the list  in this file.

Note: The iternal object is gone for now, so its a simple link.

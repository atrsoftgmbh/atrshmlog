The ATRSHMLOG fork and write test program.  {#files_atrshmlogforkwrite_c}
====================================

This program helps to check for the module in case the fork ends in a
running clone szenario.

Its name is

     atrshmlogforkwrite

This was needed in the development phase.

Now it shows you how to handle logging from different
programs in the one log buffer after you do the convert.


For the fenster;plural system you can ignore it, there is no fork
in the mingw port.

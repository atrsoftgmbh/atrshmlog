The ATRSHMLOG sort script.  {#files_atrshmlogsort_sh}
====================================

This script make a unique protocol file for
each directory it finds in the tree of directories that the
readers create.

Its name is

      atrshmlogsort

So you can combine the information from one directory.

Its a good start if you make a log with multiple buffers
and then want to create a complete info file.

The thing is better than nothing. But next after the
the module is stable i will try to make a database approch.

Sort simply cost much time.

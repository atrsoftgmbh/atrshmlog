The ATRSHMLOG shmallfiles script.  {#files_shmallfiles_script}
====================================

The file is a list of all files that are created or
already there and build the tools you need to
operate with the module.

So you can use it to copy those files to a target directory.

Example:

     $ cp $(cat shmallfiles) /usr/local/bin

The ATRSHMLOG convert helper script.  {#files_atrshmlogconv_sh}
====================================

This script is  a little helper.

Its name is

     atrshmlogconv


It uses the structure of the directory
tree  with the binary files from the readers to make
the converted text files.

Its a simple thing that comes in handy when you start to create
several hundets of files or even subdirectories.

You start it with the root directory as a parameter. The rest is
the done recursive in all directories.
